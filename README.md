**2020 | [2021](https://github.com/Shivansh-007/advent-of-code/tree/main/2021)**

Here lies my solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/), an Advent calendar full of programming puzzles from December 1st all the way to Christmas. I don't have any particularly ambitious goals, but I am trying to write the solutions using idiomatic code. In particular, it should not be possible for any input to cause one of the solutions to panic.
