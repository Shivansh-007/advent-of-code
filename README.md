**2020 | [2021](https://github.com/Shivansh-007/aoc-py/tree/main/2021)**

Here lies my python solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/), an Advent calendar full of programming puzzles from December 1st all the way to Christmas. I don't have any particularly ambitious goals, but I am trying to write the solutions using idiomatic code. In particular, it should not be possible for any input to cause one of the solutions to panic.

### Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Shivansh-007/aoc-py
$ cd aoc-py
$ poetry install
```

### Usage

- *Setup a template for a day's puzzle*
    ```bash
    $ python -m aoc start --day {day}
    ```

- *Run and submit the solution*
    ```bash
    $ python -m 2021.{day}.solution
    ```
